## Conclusion

Take a long, hard look at your own programs, scripts, and websites.
Are they safe enough?
Have you validated all inputs?
Is your input validation strict enough that it cannot be bypassed?
These are the questions the contest made me ask myself.
When you really put yourself in the shoes of an attacker,
you start asking different questions,
and you may discover mistakes you overlooked before.

Many programmers might not fully understand just how dangerous their own creations might be.
That's why it's important to take a shot at security challenges like this.
You might learn a thing or two in the process,
and hopefully write safer code in the future.
