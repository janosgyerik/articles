How about *your own* programs?
Are they safe enough?
Have you validated all inputs?
Is your input validation hard enough that it cannot be bypassed?

These are some of the questions the contest made me ask myself.

I cannot stress enough,
that I'm just a programmer,
not a security expert.
While it's not my profession to crack code,
at the same time I have to write code that cannot be cracked.
I believe most programmers don't really just how dangerous their own creations can be.
That's why it's important to take a shot at challenges like this.
You might learn a thing or two in the process,
and hopefully write safer code in the future.

Going through the original online hacking contest was an eye-opener for me,
as I could witness with my own eyes how seemingly innocent programs can be abused.
I had a wonderful time and came out enlightened.
I think the lessons are extremely important for all professional programmers,
and relevant for system administrators too.
