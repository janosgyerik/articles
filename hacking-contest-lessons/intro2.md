# Programming security lessons from a hacking contest, Part 2

In Part 1,
we got started using the Capture The Flag Live CD,
a "security wargame" with 6 levels built into an ultra-light,
remastered version of Tiny Core Linux,
and we completed the first 3 levels.
If you're joining only now,
perhaps you can try your luck at the first 3 levels yourself,
they are much easier than the remaining 3.

You can download the latest ISO image from SourceForge:

You can find further information about using the live CD on the project's website:

Keep in mind that I'm a programmer, not a security expert.
The goal of this article is not to give you the solutions of the challenges on a silver platter,
but to explain the thought process of finding security holes.
By applying the same kind of critical thinking to your own programs,
you can protect them better against attackers.
