The hacking contest itself is implemented as a bootable ISO
image: an ultra-light Linux live CD, in less than 30 megabytes.
Readers can download the ISO image from SourceForge and play with
it on their own computers. The scripts to build the live CD is
itself an open-source project:

You can download the ISO and play with it anytime you want on your own computer,
or in your favorite virtualization tool.

- get the CD
- create a VM
    - using kvm
    - using virtualbox
- give enough memory
- setup network access
- using ssh and scp

The article will spoil the hacking contest. The solutions have
not been published before. But I think it's worth it. Ideally
programmers should go through the levels all by themselves, as it
would train their investigative thinking to detect better the
security holes in their own programs. As an alternative, the
article will provide the explanations and lessons to learn,
increasing the awareness of common mistakes and vulnerabilities,
hopefully leading to more careful coding.
