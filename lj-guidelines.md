## Items to include

* Author bio in 2-3 sentences, for example:

        > Joe Author has been a UNIX systems administrator for ten
        > years. He keeps ducks and freshwater shrimp for a hobby and
        > welcomes your comments sent to joe@ducksnshrimp.org.

* Mailing address (won't be published)

* Optional items:

        * Alternate titles (if you cannot decide on one)
        * Sidebars: short standalone blocks can be helpful
        * Screenshots, especially for GUI programs
        * Teaser or summary text, see LJ TOC for samples


## Writing style

* Pick a topic you care about.

* Be conversational. Directly address the reader. Use imperatives.

* Write as though you were chatting with an intelligent friend who
  may not be familiar with the specifics of what you are covering.
  Never talk down to the reader.

* Use short sentences. It helps.

* Use short words, unless the exact word you need happens to be long.

* Be careful with humor. Sarcasm and irony are misread easily and can
  be offensive. Many readers have English as a second language and
  may not be familiar with your culture's running jokes and topical
  matters.

* Please have a technically competent colleague look over your work,
  especially any code, before submitting it.

* Do not use passive voice:

        > Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get
        > around using a passive verb. The difference between an
        > active-verb style and a passive-verb style -- in clarity
        > and vigor -- IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR
        > A WRITER.
        >
        > "Joe saw him" is strong. "He was seen by Joe" is weak" The
        > first is short and precise; it leaves no doubt about who
        > did what. The second is necessarily longer and it has an
        > insipid quality: something was done by somebody to someone
        > else. It's also ambiguous. How often was he seen by Joe?
        > Once? Every day? Once a week? A style that consists of
        > passive constructions will sap the reader's energy."

* Do not start a sentence with a gerund:

        > Changing the text color is as simple as...

* Do not use gerunds in your sentences:

        * BAD: "The text color is changed as simply as CLICKING on
          the Color button and SELECTING the color."

        * Good: "Click on the Color button to change the text
          color"

        * BAD: "Setup is accomplished by EDITING the configuration
          file, INSTALLING the Java Virtual Machine, and RUNNING the
          program."

        * Good: "Here is how to setup the software. Edit the
          configuration file. Then install the Java Virtual machine.
          Finally, run the program."

* Do not use "is by" in your sentences:

        > Setup IS ACCOMPLISHED BY...


## Example hostnames, domain names, and others

* Do not use unregistered domains

* `*.example.com` is fine

* Domains you own are fine

* Use IP addresses listed in http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt


## Other notes

* Acronyms: spell out when used for the first time, with the acronym
  in parentheses. Except very common acronyms such as ATA, CD, HTTP

* Avoid lengthy explanations of compiling and installing programs

* Don't use "etc" to end a list of examples. Use "such" and a comma


## What to write about

Something that:

* has never been done before

* there's no documentation for anywhere

* runs on all architectures

* is based on universally available software or a short program
  included with the article

* helps all Linux users

* produces measurable performance improvements

You probably can't do all of these in one article, but the more of
these you can do the better. If you are interested in several topics,
select the one you feel you know best for your first article.
